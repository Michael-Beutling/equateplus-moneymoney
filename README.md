# EquatePlus SE Edition plugin for MoneyMoney

A quick and dirty plugin for MoneyMoney for share depot - specifically for Equate Plus SE depots.
This is a pure personal and private project and has absolutely no relationship to any company - but might be usefull for SE employees.

It may work or not work for other depots.


## ToDos

* Not signed yet - you need to use Beta Version of MoneyMoney and currently allow unsigned extensions


## Credits 

Forked from Michael-Beutling as my specific depot requires different mapping.
Really all I changed was the mapping - so main credits to go to Michael-Beutling.
