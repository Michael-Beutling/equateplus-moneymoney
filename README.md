# EquatePlus SE Edition plugin for MoneyMoney

A quick and dirty plugin for MoneyMoney for share depot - specifically for Equate Plus SE depots.
This is a pure personal and private project and has absolutely no relationship to any company - but might be usefull for SE employees.

It may work or not work for other depots.

Released version is now signed and will run in released versions of the MoneyMoney App.


## ToDos

* Union the inital fork and the SE Edition to have one version of the EquatePlus extension
* Patches, Updates etc. may not be signed immediately  - you need to use Beta Version of MoneyMoney and currently allow unsigned extensions


## Credits 

Forked from Michael-Beutling as my specific depot requires different mapping.
Really all I changed was the mapping - so main credits to go to Michael-Beutling.
